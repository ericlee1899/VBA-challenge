# VBA-challenge (HW#2)
THE VBA of Wall Street  
Using VBA on large data sets to make repetitive tasks easier.  
Goal is to create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the ticker symbol, yearly change, percent change and the total stock volume.  
There is also conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
The script acts the same on each sheet so it is consistent.

Analysis:
Starting in 2014 the yearly change is rather positive, in 2015 it becomes more negative, and in 2016 it turns around to being positive again. The opening and closing values in 2014 are higher than 2015 and 2016 which shows a decreasing trend in stock. The total stock volume goes upwards from 2014-2015 but downwards from 2015-2016. A good portion of the tickers have a yearly change near 0% with a +-5% which means that these tickers have lower variability and higher consistency per year.
